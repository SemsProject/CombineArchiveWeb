The [http://co.mbine.org/documents/archive CombineArchive] is a zip like format to bundle latest research files and annotate them with meta data. The **!CombineArchive !WebInterface** is a web based user interface to create, modify, and share !CombineArchives. **No need for registration.** Just [http://cat.sems.uni-rostock.de/ start using the web interface]! :)

Currently, the project is under heavy development, but contributions of any kind are welcome.

The [wiki:WikiStart CombineArchive WebInterface] can be integrated without much hassle. To allow the Visitors of your website a good glimpse into the archive provided by you just add a link such as the following:

}}}


The Webinterface [wiki:Api exposes several other interfaces] for creating, modifying and deleting archives, archive-entries or meta-entries in a workspace. Most of them are meant for client-server communication, but can also be used by 3rd party software.
